### freecodecampTutorTask
This repo is my solution to the tutor page task given in web visuals course of freecodecamp.

This task is the very first task in the project section of the first course named Responsive Web Design provided by freecodecamp.

It tests your knowledge of different html properties like the image tags, div tags and the list tags.
